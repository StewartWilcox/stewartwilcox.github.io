.. Think of a tinder bio. That's what I'm going for here: complete but concise.

About me
========

I grew up in rural Manitoba, south of Portage la Prarie. Eventually I moved to Winnipeg to study at the U of M. This is where I became interested in computer science. I also learned that there are two types of people. Those who can extrapolate from incomplete data...

As a recent graduate I'm looking to start my career in computer science. However, as `Roy Brown said <https://youtu.be/rhp8jMykAVg>`_ while describing my current situation::

    ♫ "I don't pick my jobs, I'm ready for any ol' kind." ♫

I'm interested in software development, however I am great fit for a technical writer. I have a background in psychology and experience in operations. On top of that, I am familiar with modern, milti-platform techniques, and have an A+ in my "Technical Communication in Computer Science" class.

For my personal computer I run Linux and try to use free/libre software whenever possible. Currently, I am studying for the Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator Exam. Another project I am working on is building a Beowulf Cluster, which sounds for more impressive then it actually is.

I have a specialization in AI because it seemed to always be in the news and I wanted to learn more about how it worked. Plus, it meant I got to play with robots!

But enough about me...

About you
---------

I'm looking for an employer who is trying to make the world a better place. Ideally by using (and making) data-driven technologies to do so.

In a perfect world you would also have a passionate and determined team, career advancement opportunities, a flexible work environment, as well as an excellent benefits plan.

If that sounds like you::
