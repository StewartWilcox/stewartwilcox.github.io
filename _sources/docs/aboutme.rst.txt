About me
========

I grew up in rural Manitoba, Canada. Eventually, I moved to Winnipeg to study at the University of Manitoba. This is where I became interested in computer science. I also learned that there are two types of people. Those who can extrapolate from incomplete data...

I am an experienced help desk technician working in a Microsoft ecosystem. My day to day consists of working with a small, close-knit team helping end-users with any and all issues they may have. Additionally, I am a grader marker for the technical communication course at the University of Manitoba. My strong English skills and experience working with end-users are extremely beneficial.

On my home network, I try to use free/libre open-source software (FLOSS) whenever possible. My main PC runs Pop!_OS and my servers are Xubuntu. If you want to know more, I am happy to talk about it :)

The best way to reach me is through `email <mailto:stewartw@protonmail.com>`_ or `Mastodon <https://fosstodon.org/@Stewartw>`_.
