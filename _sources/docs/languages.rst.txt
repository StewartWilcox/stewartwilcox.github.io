"Languages"
===========

Below is a list of languages I have worked with in no particular order.

Unfortunately, almost all the languages I have learned are for school. This means most of my programs are solutions to assignments. As such, examples of my code are not posted but I will provide them upon request.

------------
Java
------------
| The introductory computer science courses taught programming concepts using Java. As such I have lots of experience with Java from when I was learning to program.

| :download:`Comp 1020 </docs/class_descriptions/comp1020.pdf>` - Introductory Computer Science 2
| :download:`Comp 2140 </docs/class_descriptions/comp2140.pdf>` - Data Structures and Algorithms

------------
C
------------
| One of my favourite languages to learn, and also one of the most frustrating. The computer does *exactly* what you tell it to. I've learned a lot from frequently having my programs unexpectedly crash.

------------
C++
------------
| Both Open CV and Darwin-OP 2 used C++, and we were programming the Darwin to play soccer. This took way more late nights then I care to admit, but it was worth it in the end.
| Comp 4180 - Intelligent Mobile Robotics

--------------------
Python - Tenser Flow
--------------------
| This one was a struggle. When we started using it for our neural nets for class, it was just released. The documentation wasn't really there, so it was a lot of figuring it out on our own.

------------
Prolog
------------
| I really enjoyed learning Prolog. Once I got used to the idea of running queries, I had a lot of fun with it.

------------
Rust
------------
I heard about Rust in late 2018, and since then have slowly been working my way through "The Book".

------------
YAML/JSON
------------
One of the many things I learned in my technical communications course. Used to create for dynamic API design and documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger.  

------------
Bash
------------
I've been using Linux as my main OS for the past few years. As such I have become familiar with the command line. I am writing the Linux Foundation Certified SysAdmin exam soon, so I'll have a paper to prove it.
